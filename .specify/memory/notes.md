# Authentication: 
Nice — good call thinking about orgs early. Below I’ll compare **Clerk**, **Kinde**, and **WorkOS** focused on the things you care about: organizations (multi-tenant/teams), developer experience, enterprise SSO/features, and costs during development and at scale. I used each vendor’s docs/pricing while preparing this so the numbers/limits are current. ([Clerk][1])

---

# Quick TL;DR

* **If you want fastest dev DX + beautiful auth UIs and a very generous free tier** → **Clerk**. Very dev-friendly and supports Organizations, SSO, RBAC. Free: first **10,000 MAUs and 100 active organizations** included. ([Clerk][1])
* **If you want an all-in-one dev platform (auth + billing + feature flags) to minimize extra services** → **Kinde**. Free tier already includes organizations and billing primitives, so you can build and monetize from day one. ([Kinde][2])
* **If you’re targeting Enterprise customers that require wide SSO/Directory integrations and audit/logs** → **WorkOS**. It’s focused on enterprise features (SSO, Directory Sync, Audit Logs) and is often used in front of your auth to handle many enterprise IdP integrations. Expect enterprise pricing patterns (per-org / product). ([WorkOS][3])

---

# Short feature comparison

### Organizations / multi-tenant support

* **Clerk**: First-class *Organizations* concept (teams/workspaces), membership, roles/permissions, ability to configure enterprise connections per organization (SAML/OIDC). Good docs for building B2B flows. ([Clerk][4])
* **Kinde**: Built for B2B/B2C; their free tier explicitly lists *B2B management with organizations* and includes role/permission basics. Also bundles billing and feature management useful for SaaS tenants. ([Kinde][2])
* **WorkOS**: Focus is on adding enterprise features to your existing auth. It provides org discovery, SSO, directory sync, and enterprise admin features — excellent for turnkey enterprise IdP integrations, less of a full user-management UI unless you build around it. ([WorkOS][3])

### Enterprise SSO & Directory

* **Clerk**: Supports SAML/OIDC enterprise connections at the org level. Good when you want both dev DX and enterprise SSO in one product. ([Clerk][4])
* **Kinde**: Provides SSO options (social, OIDC), and is positioning itself as a combined auth + billing platform — check their docs for enterprise IdP depth if you expect many large customers. ([Kinde][2])
* **WorkOS**: Best in class for enterprise SSO, directory sync (AD, Azure AD, Google Workspace), and audit/logs. Companies often use WorkOS to quickly support *many* enterprise IdPs with one integration. ([WorkOS][3])

### Developer experience & SDKs

* **Clerk**: Very polished SDKs + prebuilt React/UIs, strong DX for building sign-in flows quickly. Good docs and examples for multi-tenant apps. ([Clerk][5])
* **Kinde**: SDKs and hosted UI; marketed to developers as a “platform” (auth + billing + access). If you want fewer third-party integrations overall, Kinde lowers integration count. ([Kinde][6])
* **WorkOS**: SDKs focused on enterprise features. Works best *with* your auth (or combined with a provider like Auth0/Clerk) rather than replacing a full CIAM for all use cases. ([WorkOS][3])

---

# Pricing & cost considerations (development and live)

### Clerk

* **Free tier**: **First 10,000 MAUs and 100 active organizations are free** (and development mode exposes all features). That is very friendly for dev and early production. After free limits, pricing scales per MAU and per product features. Great for minimizing dev costs. ([Clerk][1])

### Kinde

* **Free tier**: Kinde’s free plan explicitly lists organizations, billing primitives, MFA, etc. Their paid tiers remove branding, add higher throughput / transaction handling (G2 lists a Plus at \~\$75/mo with transaction fees removed). Because Kinde bundles billing and access management you may save money by not adding a separate billing provider during early productization. ([Kinde][2])

### WorkOS

* **Pricing model**: WorkOS sells enterprise features modularly (SSO, Directory Sync, Audit Logs). They emphasize “pay as you go” and have enterprise org pricing; some public comparisons note flat org fees for SSO (WorkOS has historically quoted things like \$125/org for SSO in comparisons). WorkOS is more likely to become costly once you onboard multiple paying enterprises that require dedicated SSO/Directory features. If you only need simple auth for customers, WorkOS may be overkill. ([WorkOS][7])

---

# Practical recommendations for a cost-sensitive SaaS

1. **Start with Clerk or Kinde during development**

   * **Clerk** if you want the absolute fastest integration and excellent prebuilt UI components. Their free MAU/org limits let you develop and even launch without much auth cost. ([Clerk][1])
   * **Kinde** if you want auth **plus** billing and feature flags bundled so you don’t integrate Stripe / a feature-flag service immediately — that reduces operational overhead and potential cost. ([Kinde][2])

2. **Plan for enterprise SSO later (opt-in)**

   * If you expect to sell to enterprises that require AD/Azure/Google Workspace SSO or SCIM/Directory Sync, plan a path:

     * Option A (simpler): Use Clerk/Kinde for primary auth and *add WorkOS later* only for enterprise customers that need many IdP integrations. WorkOS is designed exactly for that: add enterprise features to an existing app. ([WorkOS][3])
     * Option B: If you think most customers will already be enterprise from day one, evaluate WorkOS up front — but expect higher ongoing costs (per-org or per-product). ([WorkOS][7])

3. **Concrete cost-saving path**

   * Dev & MVP: **Clerk free** (use their Organizations & hosted UI) or **Kinde free** (if you want built-in billing). Both get you to an MVP quickly at minimal cost. ([Clerk][1])
   * When onboarding your first paying enterprise customer who needs SSO/SCIM: evaluate **WorkOS** as an add-on to handle IdP and directory integrations — you won’t have to rework your core auth. ([WorkOS][3])

---

# Pros & cons (short)

* **Clerk**

  * Pros: superb DX, prebuilt UI, large free MAU/org allowances, orgs + SSO support. Low friction to ship. ([Clerk][1])
  * Cons: If you need built-in billing/feature flags you’ll still integrate other services (Stripe, LaunchDarkly, etc).

* **Kinde**

  * Pros: Auth + billing + access in one platform; free orgs & billing primitives — good if you want fewer vendors and to monetize fast. ([Kinde][2])
  * Cons: Newer than some incumbents; check enterprise IdP depth if you target very large customers.

* **WorkOS**

  * Pros: Best for rapid enterprise SSO and directory integrations, audit logs, SCIM. Integrates with your existing auth. ([WorkOS][3])
  * Cons: Enterprise focus means pricing and per-org costs can be higher if you need the feature for many customers.

---

# What I’d do if I were you (step-by-step)

1. **MVP / dev**: Use **Clerk free** if your priority is speed and low cost — you’ll get orgs + great UI and low/no bill while iterating. If you want billing + auth in one place, try **Kinde free**. ([Clerk][1])
2. **Instrument usage / estimate MAUs & orgs**: Track how many active users and organizations you actually need (Clerk’s MAU/org thresholds are generous, but you should know your growth curve). ([Clerk][1])
3. **Enterprise customers**: When a customer requires enterprise SSO/SCIM, add **WorkOS** (or use Clerk’s enterprise connections if you prefer one vendor)—compare the per-org cost vs your customer’s willingness to pay. ([Clerk][4])

---

If you like, I can:

* make a **three-column cost+feature spreadsheet** (Clerk / Kinde / WorkOS) with the exact free limits, common paid tiers, and the integration work you’ll need (Stripe, SCIM, RBAC) — handy for an engineering/product plan; **or**
* produce a short **roadmap** that shows which vendor to use at MVP vs when to add WorkOS for enterprise customers.

# SaaS Auth Providers Comparison

| Feature / Vendor                 | **Clerk**                                                                | **Kinde**                                                          | **WorkOS**                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Auth**                    | Full CIAM: email/password, social, passkeys, magic links, MFA            | Full CIAM: email/password, social, MFA                             | Not a full CIAM, instead adds enterprise features on top of your auth                             |
| **Organizations / Multi-tenant** | ✅ Built-in “Organizations” (teams, roles, membership)                    | ✅ Built-in orgs & roles, part of free plan                         | ⚠️ Provides “Organizations API” + directory sync; meant for enterprise SSO, not consumer org mgmt |
| **Enterprise SSO (SAML, OIDC)**  | ✅ Yes, attach enterprise IdPs per org                                    | ✅ Yes, but fewer enterprise IdPs compared to WorkOS                | 🏆 Best in class — supports most IdPs (Okta, Azure AD, Google, Ping, etc.)                        |
| **Directory Sync (SCIM, HRIS)**  | ❌ Limited (some SCIM via enterprise features)                            | ❌ Not core                                                         | ✅ Yes, broad SCIM & directory integrations                                                        |
| **Audit Logs / Compliance**      | Basic event logs                                                         | Basic logs                                                         | ✅ Enterprise-grade audit logs, webhook events                                                     |
| **SDKs & DX**                    | 🏆 Very polished SDKs, prebuilt UIs (React, Next.js, etc.), excellent DX | Good SDKs + hosted UI; simpler all-in-one flow                     | SDKs focus on enterprise SSO & directories; less for general UI/auth                              |
| **Extra features**               | Focused on auth/identity                                                 | Bundles **billing, feature flags, access control**                 | Adds **enterprise-only features** (SSO, directory sync, audit logs)                               |
| **Free tier (2025)**             | **10,000 MAUs + 100 orgs free**                                          | **Free forever tier with orgs, billing, MFA**                      | Free developer sandbox; enterprise features often **\$125/org/month** (historical pricing)        |
| **Scaling cost**                 | After free → MAU-based pricing                                           | Paid plans (e.g. \~\$75/mo to remove limits/branding + usage fees) | Enterprise pricing, usually per-org and per-product module                                        |
| **Best fit**                     | SaaS apps needing fast DX, orgs, and cheap/free early stage              | Startups wanting auth + billing + feature flags bundled            | SaaS targeting **enterprise customers** who demand SSO/Directory integrations                     |

---

✅ **My take if cost-sensitive & early stage**

* Start with **Clerk** (if you want plug-and-play auth + orgs + UI, very generous free tier)
* Or use **Kinde** (if you also want billing + feature flags bundled, fewer services to integrate)
* Add **WorkOS later** only if you land enterprise clients who require deep SSO/SCIM integrations.

---

Do you want me to also make a **cost projection table** (e.g. “100 users, 1k users, 10k users” → what Clerk/Kinde/WorkOS would cost)? That might help estimate your spend when you go live.


Tak — znalazłem sporo nowych rzeczy w Clerk i Kinde. Oto co udało mi się wychwycić, co może Cię interesować:

## Clerk — nowe funkcje / zmiany

| Data                      | Co nowego                                                                                                                                                                                                | Co to oznacza dla SaaS / organizacji                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **10 lipca 2025**         | Wprowadzono *top-level Features* (konstrukcję Features jako pierwszorzędną w aplikacji), przebudowano stronę zarządzania Ról & Uprawnień (Roles & Permissions). ([Clerk][1])                             | Możesz definiować “features” w Clerk (np. “funkcja premium”, “eksperymentalna funkcja”) i przypisywać je do ról albo używać helperów/auth guardów typu `has()`, `protect()` etc. Ułatwia budowę modelu funkcji (feature flags) + kontrolę dostępu w aplikacji bez konieczności osobnego narzędzia. |
| **13 czerwca 2025**       | Ulepszenia OAuth: wprowadzenie *OAuth scoped access*, czyli aplikacje zewnętrzne mogą uzyskiwać tokeny z ograniczonym zakresem uprawnień (scope), potwierdzanie i weryfikacja tokenów, itd. ([Clerk][2]) | To duży plus jeśli planujesz API, integracje zewnętrzne, aplikacje trzecie, albo chcesz pozwolić klientom dać dostęp komuś innemu (np. integracje). Umożliwia bardziej granulowane uprawnienia zamiast “wszystko albo nic”.                                                                        |
| **Integracja z Supabase** | Clerk ma lepsze wsparcie dla integracji Supabase: od \~kwietnia 2025 zmienili sposób integracji ze “szablonami JWT” na natywne wsparcie dla zewnętrznego OAuth, co upraszcza. ([SuperTokens][3])         | Jeśli używasz Supabase jako bazy danych / backendu, to ułatwia budowę autoryzacji + reguł (np. row-level security) z Clerk jako auth providerem. Mniej konfiguracji własnej, lepsza spójność / bezpieczeństwo.                                                                                     |

## Kinde — nowe funkcje / zmiany

Z rzeczami od Kinde:

| Data                 | Co nowego                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Co to oznacza                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **29 sierpnia 2025** | *Device Authorization Flow* — obsługa flow urządzeń. („Authentication” update) ([updates.kinde.com][4])                                                                                                             | Użyteczne jeśli chcesz wspierać logowanie z urządzeń, które nie mają łatwej metody wprowadzania loginu (np. TV, IoT).                                                         |
| **5 sierpnia 2025**  | **M2M apps scoped to organizations** — teraz możesz tworzyć aplikacje typu machine-to-machine (M2M) w obrębie organizacji, ograniczając (scoping) funkcjonalność / API dla tych aplikacji. ([updates.kinde.com][4]) | Jeśli Twoje orgy (klienci, zespoły) potrzebują własnych API/ integracji bez “pełnego dostępu”, to bardzo pomocna funkcja. Pozwala na większą separację/bezpieczeństwo.        |
| **30 czerwca 2025**  | Billing (rachunki, płatności) + “self-serve portals” + Account API itd. ([updates.kinde.com][4])                                                                                                                    | Dobrze – od razu możesz mieć panel, w którym klienci (organizacje) mogą zarządzać swoją subskrypcją/płatnościami, masz gotowe API konta, co przyspiesza monetizację produktu. |
| **30 maja 2025**     | Możliwość konfigurowania sesji *na poziomie organizacji* (dla planu “Scale” Kinde) — np. definiujesz, ile sesji / jak długo one trwają per org. ([updates.kinde.com][4])                                            | Ważne dla bezpieczeństwa i zasobów: np. chcesz, żeby organizacje miały sesje wygasające wcześniej albo różne limity. Pomaga kontrolować zużycie/ryzyko.                       |

# RTC chatgpt discussion: https://chatgpt.com/share/68ce5cd5-183c-8008-96c6-5045c6c50c2d

There’s no one “best” tool that fits *all* use-cases—for a Next.js app, the “right” real-time communication tool depends heavily on your requirements (scale, latency, persistence, cost, hosting, etc.). But I can compare the leading options, their trade-offs, and when to pick each. If you tell me your scenario (e.g. chat app, collaboration, video, how many users, what hosting, budget) I can recommend more precisely.

Here are strong contenders + comparison, pros & cons, and guidelines:

---

## Key criteria to evaluate

Before picking, think about:

| Criterion                          | Why it matters                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Latency & performance**          | Real time means very low lag for features like chat, live updates, presence, video.                                       |
| **Scalability**                    | Number of clients, rooms, throughput. Will you need to serve many concurrent users?                                       |
| **Persistence & storage**          | Do you just push events, or do you need to store historical data? Search / query past results?                            |
| **State management**               | Presence, status, who is online; sync of UI state etc.                                                                    |
| **Security & access control**      | Authentication, authorization, encryption, multi-tenant etc.                                                              |
| **Hosting constraints**            | If you use serverless platforms (like Vercel), they may have limitations for long-lived WebSocket/connection persistence. |
| **Cost / infrastructure overhead** | Self-hosting vs using a managed service; how much work you want to do vs what you want out of the box.                    |
| **Features beyond messaging**      | Video / audio, presence, global distribution, offline behavior, etc.                                                      |

## Common tools / technologies & how they stack up

Here are popular tools people use with Next.js for real-time:

| Tool / Tech                                    | What it does well / when appropriate                                                                                                                                                                                           | Drawbacks / challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Socket.IO (or pure WebSockets / “ws” etc.)** | Full control. Good for chat, presence, custom event protocols. Many tutorials integrate Socket.IO with custom Next.js server. ([Perficient Blogs][1]) Works well when you control the server environment (stateful).           | Scaling across multiple server instances requires sticky sessions or distributing events (e.g. via Redis pub/sub). Hosting on serverless / platforms that don’t support persistent connections is harder. More boilerplate. |
| **Supabase Realtime**                          | Managed service: subscriptions out of the box via Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY. Integrated with authentication, storage etc. Good if your data is in Postgres and you want real-time updates. ([Wikipedia][2])                       | Might be less flexible for custom event types; possible latency depending on setup; costs scale with usage. Also, you still might need UI-level logic for certain real-time patterns.                                       |
| **Firebase (Realtime Database or Firestore)**  | Very easy to setup. Great SDKs. Very mature. Good for simple chat, presence, notifications. Offline support, simple syncing. Many use‐cases covered.                                                                           | Less control over server logic. Costs may blow up depending on read/write patterns. Querying large history can be expensive. Possibly vendor lock-in.                                                                       |
| **Pusher / Ably / PubNub etc.**                | Highly managed. Many advanced features (presence, global realtime, fallback protocols, etc.). They handle scaling, fallback, reliability. Low startup friction. Good when you don’t want to manage your own WebSocket servers. | Cost increases with scale. Some data may go through third-party services (privacy / compliance concerns). Less control. Sometimes more latency depending on region / plan.                                                  |
| **tRPC with WebSocket / Subscriptions**        | If you're already using tRPC, adding subscriptions (real-time) may fit neatly. Type safety end-to-end. Good if you like strong typing and fewer moving parts. ([Go2Share][3])                                                  | More limited ecosystem; you may need to integrate with a WebSocket server or use wrappers. Also scaling & hosting considerations remain.                                                                                    |
| **WebRTC**                                     | Good for peer-to-peer video/audio or direct media streaming. When you need low latency media streaming.                                                                                                                        | Complexity: signaling, NAT traversal, fallback, infrastructure (TURN servers), etc. Not ideal for simple text messaging.                                                                                                    |

## What people are doing with Next.js in practice

* Many developers use **Socket.IO** for real-time chat and notifications in Next.js, especially when they have a custom server. ([Perficient Blogs][1])
* Supabase is gaining popularity because it gives you realtime databases + authentication + managed infra, so less overhead. ([StackShare][4])
* For serverless/appliance where persistent connections are tricky (e.g. Vercel), using managed real-time services (Pusher, Ably, Supabase, or Firebase) tends to be easier. ([Reddit][5])
* Some use combinations: e.g. WebSockets / Socket.IO for events, plus a realtime DB to store data; or using Redis pub/sub to scale across servers. ([DEV Community][6])

## Recommendations

Here are some guideline recommendations depending on your scenario:

| Scenario                                                                                                                                        | Tool(s) I’d suggest                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You want full flexibility, custom behavior, hosting your own backend, fine control over events, and maybe video/audio later                     | Socket.IO (or raw WebSockets), possibly plus Redis for pub/sub, etc. Also consider using tRPC subscriptions if you prefer typed APIs.          |
| Your data is already in Postgres, you want real-time updates to data (e.g. posts/comments), user presence etc., and you prefer managed services | Supabase Realtime is very appealing.                                                                                                           |
| Simple chat / notifications, low volume, want fastest development / less ops overhead                                                           | Firebase / Firestore, or Pusher / Ably.                                                                                                        |
| Large scale, global audience, need high reliability, possibly video or media, want presence etc.                                                | Managed real-time APIs (Pusher, Ably), or build your own with WebSockets + scaling infrastructure; also consider edge capabilities, CDNs, etc. |

If you tell me **your specific use-case** (e.g. chat vs notification vs video, expected number of users, deployment environment, cost constraints), I can propose the best tool (or few) for *your* situation. Do you want me to do that?

If you’re self-hosting on a VPS with Docker (dockploy), and you want something fairly easy + secure + well integrated with Next.js, here are some solid options + what I’d recommend. I’ll also include how to secure them, and trade-offs.

---

## Good options for WebSockets with Next.js in a self-hosted setup

Here are a few libraries / patterns that people use which work pretty well in VPS + Docker, are easy to get running, and have decent security.

| Option                                                                               | Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Considerations / Setup effort                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`next-ws`**                                                                        | Very nice integration: it lets you export `SOCKET` (or `UPGRADE`) handlers in Next.js app directory, so you don’t need a totally separate WebSocket server. ([GitHub][1]) Advantages: simpler to maintain in one codebase, easier to deploy. | Because it patches Next.js, you need to keep it compatible when Next.js updates. Also, it only works with “server-based” deployment (i.e. not serverless). ([npm][2]) Also, you need to manage scaling and persistence (if needed) yourself. |
| **Socket.IO + custom server / API route**                                            | Very mature, many resources, good client SDK, reconnection logic, fallbacks etc. If you run Next.js with a custom Node HTTP server (or use an API route + upgrade the connection), it works well. Many examples. ([Howik][3])                | Adds overhead; socket.io has its protocol over WebSocket (so more weight), plus you need to handle CORS, auth, possibly room/namespace logic. Also ensure TLS or HTTPS + WSS for secure transport.                                           |
| **Using `ws` (raw WebSocket library)** with a custom server or API “upgrade” handler | Very lightweight, minimal overhead, simpler surface area (less magic), you have full control. Good if you want only basic real-time messaging, presence, etc.                                                                                | You’ll need to build more yourself: reconnection logic, message formats, scaling across multiple processes/nodes (if you run more than one instance), handling load, etc.                                                                    |

---

## Security considerations

Since you’re self-hosting, some things you’ll want to set up regardless of which library you pick:

1. **Use TLS / SSL**
   Use HTTPS / WSS (secure WebSockets). Either terminate SSL at a reverse proxy (e.g. NGINX, Caddy, Traefik) or inside Docker if you’ll manage certificates (Let’s Encrypt etc.). This ensures data in transit is encrypted.

2. **Authentication**
   WebSocket connections often evade some of the usual HTTP auth flows. You’ll want a way to verify who is connecting. Common methods:

   * Use JWT in the WebSocket URL query string or in initial message/headers.
   * Use cookies + sessions (if your Next.js / backend includes them).
   * On connect, verify the credentials (token etc.), reject unauthorized.

3. **Authorization & Access Control**
   After auth, enforce what each user is allowed to do: which “rooms”, which events etc. Don’t rely on client to enforce anything.

4. **Rate limiting / message validation**
   Validate the data format. Beware malicious inputs. Possibly limit message size / event rates to avoid abuse.

5. **Graceful handling of disconnects / reconnection**
   Avoid memory leaks; clean up dead connections.

6. **Scaling / state sharing**
   If you run multiple instances (for load, redundancy), you need a way to share state (e.g. user presence, room membership) across them. Often via Redis pub/sub, or some message broker. Even if you start with one instance, plan for possible scaling.

7. **Deployment & container setup**
   In Docker, ensure that the WebSocket port (or route) is exposed and proxied correctly. If using a reverse proxy, ensure it supports WebSocket upgrades. Make sure to configure timeouts well (WebSockets are long-lived connections).

---

## Recommendation: What I’d Pick

Given your constraints (self-hosted VPS, Docker, ease + security), here is what I’d do:

* Use **`next-ws`** (or something very similar) if your WebSocket needs are modest (chat, notifications, presence). It keeps everything in your Next.js project so less moving parts.
* Pair with **`ws`** under the hood. `next-ws` uses `ws` anyway.
* Use a reverse proxy like **NGINX** or **Caddy** in front of your Docker containers to handle TLS and HTTP ↔ WebSocket upgrades.
* Use JWT tokens for authenticating connections. For example, on connect, require a valid JWT token passed in a header or query param, verify it before allowing subscription.
* If scaling is needed later, introduce Redis pub/sub for cross-instance messaging.

---

## Example minimal setup sketch

Here’s a minimal starter sketch for how you might structure this.

* Docker compose with two services:

  * Next.js app (using `next-ws`)
  * Reverse proxy (NGINX or Traefik) in front, handling TLS and routing `/api/ws` (or whatever your WS endpoint) to the Next.js container, handling WebSocket upgrade headers.

* In Next.js (with `app` router, using `next-ws`):

  ```ts
  // app/api/ws/route.ts
  import { SOCKET } from 'next-ws';
  import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

  export function SOCKET(
    client: import('ws').WebSocket,
    request: import('http').IncomingMessage,
    server: import('ws').WebSocketServer
  ) {
    // Extract token (e.g. from query or header)
    const url = new URL(request.url!, `http://${request.headers.host}`);
    const token = url.searchParams.get('token');
    if (!token) {
      client.close(4001, 'Unauthorized');
      return;
    }
    let payload;
    try {
      payload = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!);
    } catch (e) {
      client.close(4001, 'Unauthorized');
      return;
    }

    // Now handle messages
    client.on('message', (msg) => {
      // Validate message, etc.
      // Send something back or broadcast etc.
      client.send(`Echo: ${msg}`);
    });
    client.on('close', () => {
      // Clean up
    });
  }
  ```

* NGINX config snippet (reverse proxy) for WebSocket upgrades:

  ```
  server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    # SSL certs, etc...

    location /api/ws {
      proxy_pass http://nextjs_container:3000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://nextjs_container:3000;
      # rest of settings
    }
  }
  ```

If you like, I can put together a more complete template / boilerplate (Docker files, NGINX reverse proxy, authentication) for you to use, adapted to your setup. Do you want me to build that for you?

Cool, good choices: Kinde for auth + Cloudflare for exposure. I’ll sketch how to integrate Kinde + WebSockets + Next.js, plus Cloudflare in front. Then give a concrete template you can adapt.

---

## What Kinde gives you (relevant parts)

From Kinde docs:

* They issue **JWTs** for access tokens. ([Kinde docs][1])
* They use an asymmetric signing algorithm (RS256) and public JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) so your backend (or WebSocket server) can verify signatures without having to store secrets. ([Kinde docs][2])
* Access tokens include standard claims (`iss`, `aud`, `sub`, `exp`) plus custom claims like permissions, feature flags etc. ([Kinde docs][1])

So you can rely on Kinde for issuing JWTs, then in Next.js / your WebSocket handler verify them using JWKS.

---

## What Cloudflare offers / what you need to configure

* Cloudflare *supports proxied WebSocket connections* out of the box, when DNS is proxied (orange cloud) on your domain. ([Cloudflare Docs][3])
* You’ll need to turn on WebSocket support in Cloudflare (toggle in Dashboard under Network) if it isn’t already. ([Cloudflare Docs][3])
* Ensure SSL/TLS is configured securely. Usually use “Full (strict)” mode so certificate on origin (your VPS) is validated. Use WSS on the client side. ([WebSocket.org][4])

---

## Putting it all together: Architecture + Flow

Here is the flow you’d want, plus how components interact:

```
[Client (Browser)]  
   ↕ (wss://your-domain.com/socket or /api/ws)  
[Cloudflare (Edge / CDN etc.)]  
   ↕ (proxied)  
[Your VPS Docker-stack]  
   ├ Next.js app (with WebSocket handler, JWT verification)  
   ├ Reverse proxy in front (optional / helpful: NGINX / Traefik)  
   └ Other services (maybe Redis etc if scaling)  
```

Flow:

1. Client authenticates via Kinde. Gets access token (JWT).

2. Client opens WebSocket connection to your domain (which goes through Cloudflare). Include the JWT somehow (header or query param or initial message).

   > **Note**: WebSocket handshake does *not* allow arbitrary custom headers in all contexts, depending on browser, so query string or cookie are common. Using a cookie is more secure (if you can set HttpOnly) but also has its own security implications (cross-site etc.).

3. The WebSocket server (part of your Next.js or separate service) verifies the JWT on connect, using Kinde’s JWKS (fetch and cache the JWKS, verify signature, check `iss`, `aud`, expiry etc.). If invalid, reject / close connection.

4. Once connected, you manage messages etc. Enforce authorization based on claims (permissions etc).

5. Cloudflare ensures the connection is encrypted (wss), handles reverse proxying, maybe WAF and firewall rules etc to limit abuse.

---

## Key security concerns & mitigations

* **Token in query string**: Might get logged, visible in referrers. If put there, use short-lived or one-time tokens. Better: use cookies or use headers (if possible).
* **TLS at all points**: Client ↔ Cloudflare should be HTTPS/WSS. Cloudflare ↔ your origin should also use TLS with valid certificates.
* **Rate limiting** on WebSocket endpoints (both for opening connections and for messages) to prevent abuse / DoS. Cloudflare can help.
* **Correct CORS / origin checks**: Make sure that only allowed clients can connect (origin header etc).
* **JWT verification up-to-date**: fetch JWKS, handle key rotation.
* **Scaling / resource limits**: If many connections, you may need to use Redis for pub/sub or store connection info, or sticky sessions, depending on your setup.

---

## Template / Example

Here’s a working template you can adapt, with Next.js + a WebSocket handler, JWT verification using Kinde, deployed in Docker, with Cloudflare proxy and NGINX.

---

### Directory layout

```
your-project/
├ docker-compose.yml
├ nginx/
│   └ nginx.conf
├ src/
│   ├ next.config.js
│   ├ app/
│   │    api/
│   │        auth/[kinde]/route.ts   ← Kinde auth endpoints
│   │        ws/route.ts             ← WebSocket handler (using next-ws or raw ws)
│   ├ utils/
│   │    jwtVerifier.ts
│   └ ...
├ .env
```

---

### Sample `.env`

```env
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
KINDE_ISSUER=https://your_subdomain.kinde.com
KINDE_AUDIENCE=your_expected_audience
JWT_ALGORITHM=RS256

# For TLS if using internal certs (or leave blank if using only Cloudflare origin permissions)
TLS_CERT=/etc/ssl/certs/yourcert.pem
TLS_KEY=/etc/ssl/private/yourkey.pem
```

---

### JWT verifier util (typescript)

```ts
// src/utils/jwtVerifier.ts
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
import jwkToPem from 'jwk-to-pem';
import jwt, { JwtHeader, SigningKeyCallback, VerifyErrors } from 'jsonwebtoken';

let jwksCache: any = null;
let jwksFetchedAt = 0;
const JWKS_TTL = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour

async function getJWKS() {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (jwksCache && (now - jwksFetchedAt) < JWKS_TTL) {
    return jwksCache;
  }
  const resp = await fetch(`${process.env.KINDE_ISSUER}/.well-known/jwks`);
  if (!resp.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch JWKS');
  }
  const data = await resp.json();
  jwksCache = data;
  jwksFetchedAt = now;
  return data;
}

export async function verifyToken(token: string) {
  const jwks = await getJWKS();
  // decode header to get kid
  const decodedHeader = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true }) as { header: JwtHeader };
  if (!decodedHeader || !decodedHeader.header.kid) {
    throw new Error('Invalid token header');
  }
  const key = jwks.keys.find((k: any) => k.kid === decodedHeader.header.kid);
  if (!key) {
    throw new Error('Unknown "kid" in token');
  }
  const pem = jwkToPem(key);
  return new Promise<any>((resolve, reject) => {
    jwt.verify(token, pem, {
      algorithms: ['RS256'],
      issuer: process.env.KINDE_ISSUER,
      audience: process.env.KINDE_AUDIENCE,
    }, (err: VerifyErrors | null, payload: any) => {
      if (err) reject(err);
      else resolve(payload);
    });
  });
}
```

---

### WebSocket handler (route)

Using `ws` (or next-ws if you prefer):

```ts
// src/app/api/ws/route.ts
import { SOCKET } from 'next-ws';
import type { WebSocket } from 'ws';
import { verifyToken } from '../../utils/jwtVerifier';

export function SOCKET(client: WebSocket, request: Request, server: any /* or whatever type */) {
  // you might extract token via query param or via cookie etc
  const url = new URL(request.url! , `https://${request.headers.get('host')}`);
  const token = url.searchParams.get('token');

### NGINX reverse proxy config (for Docker / origin)

```nginx
# nginx/nginx.conf
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/privkey.pem;

    # Optional SSL settings
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location /api/ws {
        proxy_pass http://next_app:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://next_app:3000;
        # usual reverse proxy stuff...
    }
}
```

### Docker Compose (very simplified)

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  next_app:
    build: ./src
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - KINDE_CLIENT_ID=${KINDE_CLIENT_ID}
      - KINDE_ISSUER=${KINDE_ISSUER}
      - KINDE_AUDIENCE=${KINDE_AUDIENCE}
    depends_on:
      - nginx
    # volumes etc as needed

  nginx:
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - /etc/ssl/certs/fullchain.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/fullchain.pem:ro
      - /etc/ssl/private/privkey.pem:/etc/ssl/private/privkey.pem:ro
```

### Cloudflare settings

* On Cloudflare Dashboard, ensure that your domain’s DNS record is proxied (orange cloud) so Cloudflare is handling traffic.
* Enable WebSockets under **Network > WebSockets**. ([Cloudflare Docs][3])
* TLS mode “Full (strict)” for the connection between Cloudflare ↔ origin.
* Potential firewall / WAF rules to allow / protect the WebSocket endpoint (e.g. `/api/ws`).
* Rate-limiting rules for WebSocket endpoint, maybe by path + header “Upgrade: websocket”.

Yes — it *is* possible to integrate **next-ws** with tRPC to get real-time subscriptions, but there's no “official, fully baked” plug-and-play support documented out of the box (at least not in all versions) as of now. There are things you’ll need to wire yourself. I’ll go through what tRPC supports, what next-ws gives you, where they overlap well, what gaps you might have to fill, and how you might put them together.

---

## What tRPC supports

tRPC has built-in support for **subscriptions**, which allow streaming events (real-time) between server and client. ([trpc.io][1])

* For WebSocket subscriptions, tRPC provides infrastructure: there are adapters / tools like `applyWSSHandler` to help setup a WebSocket server that handles routing & subscription logic. ([trpc.io][2])
* The client side (e.g. `wsLink` etc.) supports connecting via WebSocket to receive subscription updates. ([trpc.io][2])

So tRPC already covers a lot of the real-time subscription side: defining subscription procedures, handling client reconnect, etc.

---

## What next-ws provides

`next-ws` is a package that lets you define WebSocket handlers as “routes” in the Next.js app router, using something like a `SOCKET` export in a `route.ts` file under `app/api/...`. It simplifies putting WebSockets inside the Next.js route structure; you don’t need a completely separate server setup. It uses `ws` under the hood. (As of the last references I found, that’s how people are using it) ([Medium][3])

---

## Where they overlap well & where you have to add glue

Because both tools cover different layers, you can combine them nicely, but you’ll need to build the glue:

| Piece                                                                                       | Provided by tRPC                                                                                                                                                                                         | Provided by next-ws                                                                                                                                                                            | You’ll need to implement / coordinate |

| WebSocket transport layer (raw connection, handling of `.upgrade`, maintaining connections) | Partially, via `applyWSSHandler` which expects a WebSocket server (e.g. a `ws.Server`) to be passed in. ([Stack Overflow][4])                                                                            | Yes: `next-ws` gives you a route where you get a WebSocket connection (via `SOCKET`) under the Next.js router. So next-ws handles the transport/server side part inside Next.js. ([Medium][3]) |                                       |
| Subscription logic / typed procedures / observable / client re-connection etc.              | Yes: tRPC has `subscription(...)`, `observable`, etc., plus client side `wsLink` to connect. ([trpc.io][2])                                                                                              | No: next-ws does the lower layer connection, not tRPC logic itself.                                                                                                                            |                                       |
| Context / auth / authorization in WebSocket connection                                      | tRPC expects you to provide a `createContext` that will be used for subscription requests. You need to adapt context creation when using WebSocket (token parsing, session, etc.). ([Stack Overflow][4]) | next-ws route gives you the WebSocket handshake handler where you can intercept token / headers etc. So that’s a good insertion point.                                                         |                                       |
| Integration inside Next.js app router (App Directory etc.)                                  | Developing; some complexity when using App Router vs Pages Router etc. There are discussions about limitations or missing examples.

## What to watch out for / challenges

* **App Router vs Pages Router**: Using tRPC subscriptions + WebSockets works more straightforwardly when you control a server (not serverless) and you are on a setup that allows custom WebSocket upgrade handling. If you use App Router in Next 13/14, some people report that subscriptions / WebSocket events are not working purely via the route definitions — sometimes because context creation hits server-only APIs that aren’t available in that route environment. ([GitHub][5])
* **Edge / Serverless restrictions**: If you ever move to serverless platforms, WebSocket long-lived connections are problematic. But since you’re using a VPS + Docker, that’s under your control, so that's fine.
* **Deploy / version mismatch / lifecycle**: next-ws modifies some Next.js internals (via patch etc.), so you need to be careful when upgrading Next.js to ensure no compatibility breaks. ([Medium][3])
* **Context / auth in subscription**: making sure your `createContext` function used by tRPC works correctly when called in WebSocket subscription context; e.g. access to cookies, headers, etc., must be possible.
* **Scaling**: once you have multiple instances, subscription / event broadcasting between instances requires something like Redis pub/sub etc. tRPC itself doesn’t solve the multi-instance broadcasting, just client subscription.

---

## A sketch: how you could wire them together

Here’s how I’d integrate **next-ws** with tRPC for your case (VPS + Docker + Kinde auth + full control):

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install ws next-ws @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/next zod
   ```

2. Set up a WebSocket route in `app/api/trpcws/route.ts` (or wherever) using `next-ws`, which gives you `SOCKET(...)` handler.

3. Inside the `SOCKET(...)` handler:

   * Use `applyWSSHandler` from `@trpc/server/adapters/ws`, passing in the `ws.Server` instance that next-ws gives/is capable of giving.
   * Provide your tRPC `appRouter` and a `createContext` function that verifies JWT from Kinde (maybe via a query param on connect or initial message).

4. On client side, use `wsLink` from tRPC client, point to your WebSocket route. Use `useSubscription` hooks from tRPC to subscribe.

5. Setup authentication: Since you are using Kinde, verify the JWT in `createContext`. That gives you the identity for subscription.

6. Reverse proxy / TLS via Cloudflare + NGINX etc as before, so that WSS works, the upgrade works, etc.

If you like, I can build a minimal example (repo) that shows **next-ws + tRPC + Kinde auth** working end-to-end. Would you prefer I sketch the code for that?
