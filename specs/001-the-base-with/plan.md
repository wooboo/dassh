# Implementation Plan: Project Base Setup

**Branch**: `001-the-base-with` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-the-base-with/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Feature spec loaded from D:\work\tmp\dassh\specs\001-the-base-with\spec.md
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ Project Type: web (monorepo frontend+backend structure)
   → ✅ Structure Decision: monorepo with apps/, packages/, tools/
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✅ Constitutional requirements identified and documented
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ No violations - project base aligns with constitutional requirements
   → ✅ Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check PASSED
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ Research phase completed - constitutional tech stack documented
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → ✅ Design artifacts generated
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ No new violations - design maintains constitutional compliance
   → ✅ Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check PASSED
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → ✅ Task generation approach planned
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
   → ✅ Planning phase complete
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Establish foundational project infrastructure with monorepo structure, Next.js application, and shadcn/ui integration. This creates the constitutional-compliant development environment that supports widget-centric architecture, accessibility-first design, and rapid development workflows. The base setup enables immediate feature development with proper tooling, testing infrastructure, and quality gates.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9+, Node.js 22+ (LTS)  
**Package Manager**: pnpm (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Monorepo Management**: Turborepo 2.5.6+ (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15+ (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Component Library**: shadcn/ui (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Rapid Development**: v0 for UI prototyping (CONSTITUTIONAL ALLOWANCE - requires quality refinement)  
**Authentication**: Kinde (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Database**: PostgreSQL (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**ORM**: Drizzle ORM (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Real-time Communication**: WebSocket implementation (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT)  
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright, @testing-library/react, axe-core for accessibility testing  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome 100+, Firefox 100+, Safari 15+, Edge 100+)
**Project Type**: monorepo - determines source structure  
**Performance Goals**: <3s load time, 60fps rendering, <50ms WebSocket latency, <100ms database queries  
**Constraints**: <100ms webhook response, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile-first design  
**Scale/Scope**: Foundation for dashboard application supporting multiple widgets and real-time updates

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Accessibility Compliance**: ✅ Design includes WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through shadcn/ui components, accessibility testing with axe-core, keyboard navigation support, and semantic markup validation in ESLint configuration.

**Responsive Design Validation**: ✅ Implementation demonstrates mobile-first design approach through Tailwind CSS configuration, touch-friendly interactions via shadcn/ui components, and content prioritization strategy across breakpoints.

**Widget Architecture Adherence**: ✅ All components designed as standalone widgets with webhook interfaces through base widget classes, independent testability through package structure, and standardized configuration APIs. Widget templates support placeholder-based data mapping from webhook payloads. Template system is secure (no code execution), intuitive for users, and includes validation for data binding.

**Security Implementation**: ✅ Design includes encryption for data transmission through HTTPS configuration, webhook authentication and rate limiting through Next.js API routes, input validation strategy through Zod schemas, and OWASP compliance measures through security headers.

**Data Persistence Compliance**: ✅ Database design uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe data access. All database schemas are version-controlled through migrations. Database queries are optimized with proper indexing and connection pooling.

**Rapid Development Compliance**: ✅ v0 integration for UI prototyping with constitutional compliance review process. All generated components must be reviewed and refined for constitutional compliance. AI-generated code passes accessibility, security, and performance standards before integration.

**Visual Design Standards**: ✅ Interface design demonstrates consistent design language through shadcn/ui design system, usability-driven decisions through accessibility-first principles, and professional aesthetic coherence across all components.

## Complexity & Risk Analysis

### High-Impact Decisions
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Constitutional requirement that enables shared components and consistent tooling
2. **Constitutional Tech Stack**: All technology choices are mandated by project constitution
3. **Widget Architecture Foundation**: Base classes and interfaces must support future widget development
4. **Accessibility-First Setup**: All tooling must enforce WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from project start

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- **External Dependencies**: Node.js 18+, pnpm package manager, modern browser support
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All technology choices follow established constitutional requirements
- **Development Workflow**: TDD principles and quality gates are assumed to be followed
- **Future Extensibility**: Structure must support widget development and database integration

### Risk Mitigation
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Regular validation against constitutional requirements
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing and accessibility validation from project start
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup guides and development workflows
- **Tooling Validation**: All tools configured to enforce constitutional standards

## Phase 2 Task Generation Approach
*(Planning only - tasks.md created by /tasks command)*

**Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation Setup**: Repository initialization, monorepo configuration, package structure
2. **Development Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configuration, Turborepo setup
3. **Next.js Application**: Dashboard app creation, routing, basic structure
4. **shadcn/ui Integration**: Component library setup, design system configuration
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Jest setup, accessibility testing, e2e testing framework
6. **Quality Gates**: Constitutional compliance validation, automated testing
7. **Documentation**: Setup guides, development workflows, contributing guidelines

**Execution Strategy**: TDD approach with failing tests first, followed by implementation to make tests pass. Each package developed independently with clear interfaces and dependencies.
