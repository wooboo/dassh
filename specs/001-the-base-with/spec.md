# Feature Specification: Project Base Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-base-with`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The base - With all that we know from the constitution let's setup the base for the project: repository structure, nextjs application, shadcn integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description: Setup project foundation infrastructure
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Identified: repository structure, Next.js application, shadcn/ui integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No ambiguous requirements - constitutional standards define requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Developer workflow scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable against constitutional standards
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Project structure entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details, focused on capabilities
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer joining the project, I need a properly structured development environment that follows constitutional requirements so I can immediately start building features without setup friction or compliance concerns.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh repository clone, **When** a developer runs the setup commands, **Then** they have a working development environment with all constitutional requirements met
2. **Given** the project base is established, **When** a developer creates a new component, **Then** they can use the established tooling and patterns without additional configuration
3. **Given** the monorepo structure is in place, **When** packages are added or modified, **Then** build systems and dependency management work correctly across the workspace

### Edge Cases
- What happens when constitutional requirements conflict with default tool configurations?
- How does the system handle missing dependencies or environment setup failures?
- What validation ensures all constitutional standards are properly configured?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a monorepo structure that supports independent package development and workspace orchestration
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a Next.js application foundation that meets constitutional performance and accessibility standards
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate shadcn/ui component library with proper configuration and accessibility compliance
- **FR-004**: System MUST establish build and development tooling that enforces constitutional quality gates
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear development workflows that guide developers through constitutional compliance
- **FR-006**: System MUST include proper TypeScript configuration that enables type safety across all packages
- **FR-007**: System MUST establish testing infrastructure that supports TDD principles and constitutional testing requirements
- **FR-008**: System MUST configure package management that supports constitutional dependency and caching standards
- **FR-009**: System MUST include development environment validation that verifies constitutional compliance
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide documentation and examples that demonstrate proper usage of established patterns

### Workspace Considerations *(include if feature spans multiple workspace packages)*
- **Affected Packages**: All workspace packages - this establishes the foundation structure
- **Package Dependencies**: Creates the base dependency relationships between apps/, packages/, and tools/
- **Shared Components**: Establishes shared configuration, utilities, and UI components across workspace

### Rapid Development Considerations *(include if using v0 for UI prototyping)*
- **Prototyping Scope**: Base UI components and layout structures may use v0 for rapid iteration
- **Refinement Requirements**: All generated components must meet constitutional accessibility, security, and performance standards
- **Quality Gates**: Constitutional compliance review process for any AI-generated foundation components
- **Integration Strategy**: v0 prototypes refined into shadcn/ui compatible components with proper TypeScript types

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workspace Package**: Represents individual packages within the monorepo with defined boundaries and dependencies
- **Configuration Entity**: Represents shared configuration files that enforce constitutional standards across packages
- **Development Workflow**: Represents the established patterns and tooling that guide feature development
