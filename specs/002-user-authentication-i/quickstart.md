1. Use only keyboard to navigate authentication flows
2. Tab through all interactive elements
3. Test screen reader compatibility

**Accessibility Checklist**:
- [ ] All auth controls reachable via keyboard
- [ ] Focus indicators visible and clear
- [ ] Screen reader announces auth state changes
- [ ] ARIA labels present for auth buttons and dropdowns
- [ ] Form validation errors announced to assistive technology

## Security Validation

### Session Security Test
**Steps**:
1. Check token handling and storage
2. Verify session timeout behavior
3. Test concurrent session limits

**Security Checklist**:
- [ ] Tokens stored securely (HTTP-only cookies)
- [ ] No sensitive data in local storage
- [ ] Session timeout enforced appropriately
- [ ] CSRF protection active
- [ ] XSS protection measures in place

## Cleanup

### Post-Test Cleanup
```bash
# Clean up test user data (if needed)
pnpm db:reset-test-data

# Clear browser data
# (Manual step: Clear cookies, local storage, session storage)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Kinde redirect loops**: Check KINDE_SITE_URL and redirect URLs
2. **Database connection errors**: Verify DATABASE_URL and database status
3. **Missing environment variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set
4. **CORS issues**: Check Kinde allowed origins configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check database connection
pnpm db:studio

# View application logs
pnpm dev --verbose

# Test Kinde configuration
curl -X GET "${KINDE_ISSUER_URL}/.well-known/openid_configuration"
```

- [ ] All 10 scenarios pass validation
- [ ] Performance targets are met
- [ ] Accessibility requirements satisfied
- [ ] Security validation completed
- [ ] No critical errors in browser console
- [ ] Database queries optimized and performant

This quickstart validates the complete user authentication system and confirms all functional requirements are working correctly in the integrated environment.
