# Feature Specification: User Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `002-user-authentication-i`  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "user authentication - I want users to be able to authenticate. Remember to use kinde. at the bottom left of the dashboard there is a place for a user profile dropdown. on the top right of the main page we should have an option to sign in, sign up or profile dropdown, depending on the current state"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: User authentication system with Kinde integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users (authenticated/unauthenticated)
   ‚Üí Actions: Sign in, sign up, view profile, sign out
   ‚Üí UI Components: Dashboard profile dropdown, main page auth controls
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use Kinde for authentication
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements are clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flows: Sign up, sign in, profile management, sign out
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí User entity with authentication state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec is complete and ready for implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to securely authenticate to access personalized features of the application. They should be able to create new accounts, sign into existing accounts, view their profile information, and sign out when finished. The authentication system should provide a seamless experience across both the main application page and the dashboard interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an unauthenticated user visits the main page, **When** they click the sign-up option in the top right, **Then** they are guided through account creation and automatically signed in
2. **Given** an unauthenticated user visits the main page, **When** they click the sign-in option in the top right, **Then** they can authenticate with their existing credentials
3. **Given** an authenticated user is on the main page, **When** they view the top right area, **Then** they see a profile dropdown instead of sign-in/sign-up options
4. **Given** an authenticated user is in the dashboard, **When** they look at the bottom left, **Then** they see a user profile dropdown with their information
5. **Given** an authenticated user clicks their profile dropdown, **When** they select sign out, **Then** they are logged out and redirected appropriately
6. **Given** an authenticated user clicks their profile dropdown, **When** they select profile/account settings, **Then** they can view and manage their account information
7. **Given** an unauthenticated user tries to access the `/dashboard` route directly, **When** they navigate to the URL, **Then** they are redirected to the authentication page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when authentication fails due to invalid credentials?
- How does the system handle expired authentication sessions?
- What occurs if a user tries to access dashboard features without being authenticated?
- What happens when an unauthenticated user tries to access the `/dashboard` route directly?
- How are users redirected after successful authentication from different entry points?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate with Kinde authentication service for all user authentication operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST display sign-in and sign-up options in the top right of the main page for unauthenticated users
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a user profile dropdown in the top right of the main page for authenticated users
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a user profile dropdown in the bottom left of the dashboard for authenticated users
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to create new accounts through the sign-up flow
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to authenticate with existing credentials through the sign-in flow
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow authenticated users to view their profile information
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow authenticated users to sign out from their account
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist user authentication state across browser sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST redirect users appropriately after authentication based on their intended destination
- **FR-011**: System MUST protect dashboard and other authenticated features from unauthenticated access
- **FR-012**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users away from the `/dashboard` route to an appropriate authentication page
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle authentication errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback

### Workspace Considerations *(include if feature spans multiple workspace packages)*
- **Affected Packages**: 
  - `apps/dashboard` - for dashboard profile dropdown integration
  - `packages/shared` - for authentication utilities, middleware, and types
  - Main application page (location to be determined) - for main page auth controls
- **Package Dependencies**: 
  - Dashboard app will depend on shared authentication state management
  - Shared package will provide authentication middleware and utilities
- **Shared Components**: 
  - User profile dropdown component should be shared between dashboard and main page
  - Authentication state management should be centralized in shared package
  - Kinde integration utilities should be available across all packages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an authenticated user with profile information, authentication state, and session data
- **Authentication Session**: Represents the current authentication state including tokens, expiration, and user identity
- **User Profile**: Contains user information such as name, email, preferences, and account settings
