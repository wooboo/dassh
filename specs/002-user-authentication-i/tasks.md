# Tasks: User Authentication System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-user-authentication-i/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Loaded: User Authentication System with Kinde integration
   → ✅ Extracted: Next.js, oRPC, Kinde, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: User, UserSession, UserProfile entities
   → ✅ contracts/: Authentication, profile, session management endpoints
   → ✅ research.md: Kinde integration, Next.js patterns, component strategy
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Kinde integration, database schema, oRPC procedures, profile components
   → Tests: Authentication flows, profile management, session handling, accessibility
   → Core: User models, auth middleware, profile dropdowns, route protection
   → Integration: Database connections, oRPC client, WebSocket auth
   → Polish: Performance optimization, security validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different packages/files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Selective TDD: Required for auth flows, recommended for services, optional for infrastructure
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
   → 75 tasks across 5 phases
6. Generate dependency graph: Setup → Tests → Implementation → Integration → Polish
7. Create parallel execution examples for independent packages
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✅ All API contracts have tests
   → ✅ All entities have implementation tasks
   → ✅ All components have accessibility validation
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo structure**: `apps/dashboard/src/`, `packages/ui/src/`, `tools/` at repository root
- **Workspace packages**: Each package has own `src/` and `tests/` directories
- **Shared resources**: `packages/shared/`, `packages/ui/`, `packages/config/`
- Paths shown below assume monorepo structure with Turborepo orchestration

- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each task completion
- Focus on constitutional compliance: accessibility, security, performance
- Profile dropdown must work in both dashboard (bottom-left) and main page (top-right) locations

## Constitutional Compliance v2.8.0

### Selective TDD Implementation ✅
- **TDD REQUIRED**: Business logic tests (T015-T023) must be written first and failing before implementation
- **TDD RECOMMENDED**: Core services tests (T024-T028) written with implementation  
- **Testing OPTIONAL**: Infrastructure tests (T029-T031) written after implementation if time permits
- **Quality Gates**: Accessibility, responsive design, oRPC type safety mandatory for all code (T032-T035)

### oRPC Integration Requirements ✅
- All API endpoints implemented as oRPC procedures with type-safe validation
- Frontend-backend communication uses oRPC client with automatic type inference
- OpenAPI specifications automatically generated from oRPC procedure definitions
- Type-safe error handling and input validation using Zod schemas

### Development Environment Constraints ✅
- VS Code terminal limitations acknowledged for web application testing
- User coordination required for background processes and multiple terminal operations
- Complete authentication flow testing requires user interaction with browser
- Parallel task execution examples provided for independent package development

This tasks file provides comprehensive, executable implementation guidance for the User Authentication System feature following selective TDD principles (Constitution v2.8.0), oRPC integration requirements, and monorepo best practices with parallel execution optimization.
