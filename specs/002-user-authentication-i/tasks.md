# Tasks: User Authentication System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-user-authentication-i/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ LOADED: User Authentication System with Kinde integration
   → Extract: Next.js, shadcn/ui, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Kinde, TypeScript
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: 3 entities (User, UserSession, UserProfile) → model tasks
   → ✅ contracts/: 8 API endpoints → contract test tasks  
   → ✅ research.md: Kinde integration, v0 prototyping → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Kinde config, database schema, middleware, v0 setup
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, accessibility, security
   → Core: authentication components, profile dropdowns, route protection
   → Integration: database migrations, auth flows, session management
   → Polish: performance optimization, documentation, final validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✅ All contracts have tests
   → ✅ All entities have models
   → ✅ All endpoints implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

Task: "Contract test GET /api/user/profile in apps/dashboard/tests/contract/test_user_profile_get.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/user/sessions in apps/dashboard/tests/contract/test_user_sessions_get.ts"
Task: "Database integration test User CRUD in packages/shared/tests/database/test_user_crud.ts"
Task: "Accessibility test profile dropdowns in packages/ui/tests/accessibility/test_profile_dropdown_a11y.ts"
```

### Phase 3.3 Models & Services
```bash
# Launch entity models together:
Task: "User entity model with Drizzle schema in packages/shared/src/database/schema.ts"
Task: "User service layer with database operations in packages/shared/src/services/user-service.ts"
Task: "AuthButton component with shadcn/ui in packages/ui/src/components/auth-button.tsx"
Task: "ProfileDropdown widget component in packages/ui/src/components/profile-dropdown.tsx"
```

### Phase 3.5 Polish & Validation
```bash
# Launch final validation together:
Task: "Performance optimization for authentication queries in packages/shared/src/services/"
Task: "Accessibility audit with axe-core for all auth components"
Task: "Unit tests for authentication services in packages/shared/tests/unit/"
Task: "Documentation update for authentication system in docs/authentication.md"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each task completion
- Focus on constitutional compliance: accessibility, security, performance
- Profile dropdown must work in both dashboard (bottom-left) and main page (top-right) locations
